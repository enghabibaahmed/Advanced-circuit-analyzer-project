# Advanced circuit analyzer project
  C++ program to analyze electrical circuits and compute total resistance based on a user-defined string representation of resistors and their connections. The program efficiently parses input to identify series (S) and parallel (P) connections, handling nested circuits and multiple-digit resistance values. It utilizes string manipulation, custom digit extraction functions, and error handling to ensure accurate calculations.
