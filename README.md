# Advanced circuit analyzer project
 This is a C++ program that calculates the total resistance of an electrical circuit based on a user-provided string description. The electrical circuit will be described as One String, where the type of connection between resistors is  represented by either 'S' (Series) or 'P' (Parallel). Characters are either separated by spaces or commas.
